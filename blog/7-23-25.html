  <p>So uh... yeah. I'm a furry! You may have already come to this conclusion based on some of the newer additions to this site, but here's an 'official' announcement to confirm any suspicions XD</p>
  
  <p>I guess I've had this lingering interest in anthros ever since I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hood_(1973_film)" target="_blank">Robin Hood (1973)</a> when I was really young. Around three years ago (I'm gonna be completely honest, I think it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bad_Guys_(film)" target="_blank">The Bad Guys (2022)</a> that did it, haha) this interest started to kind of spiral out of control... I've only recently let it show a bit, and now it's gotten to the point where I just kinda want to be myself and stop trying to hide it. So here we are :P</p>

  <p>I will say I don't think I'm a <b>furry</b> furry like people usually think of when they hear the term. I don't (really) have a fursona and I'm not absolutely dying to make one, and I'm also not involved in the... uh... <i>interesting</i> side of the community. I really just enjoy the art and culture! It's great stuff, and there are some incredibly talented people in the fandom.</p>

  <p>At first I was a bit hesitant to say I'm actually a furry because of that... initially I thought being a furry meant you practically <b>were</b> your sona, and suiting had to be a thing you did in order to be classified as one. But apparently you just have to have an interest in anthros, at least according to <a href="https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Furry" target="_blank">WikiFur</a>--</p>

      <b>What it means to <i>be</i> furry</b>

    <p>
      Someone who says they are furry is generally expressing an interest in anthropomorphic animals and/or creatures (and perhaps some affiliation to furry fandom). They may say that interest in a variety of ways - through art and stories roleplay and performance. How deep or meaningful interest in furry varies greatly from person to person.

  <p>Anyways, just wanted to throw that out there so I feel better about expressing that side of me more! Sorry not sorry to all the people who despise furries I suppose ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

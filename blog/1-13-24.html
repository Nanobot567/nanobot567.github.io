  <p class="rainbow">Today officially marks a full year of blogging!!</p>

  I may rework the blogging page soon, in case I end up writing a lot more this year. Maybe with a dropdown for 2023
  blog posts? We'll see, I guess.

  <p />

  Here's a bunch of things I did last year:

  <ol>
    <li>I finished <a href="https://github.com/AOS-GUI/AOS-GUI" target="_blank">AOS-GUI</a> v0.9!</li>
    <li>I released <a href="https://github.com/nanobot567/CS-16" target="_blank">CS-16</a>!</li>
    <li>I updated my website to look a lot better (in my opinion, anyway)</li>
    <li>I joined Mastodon!</li>
    <li><span class="redacted">IT ENDED</span></li>
    <li>I broke my Playdate, but got a replacement!</li>
    <li>I got a little better at drawing</li>
    <li>I started doing hardware stuff (breadboards for now)</li>
    <li>I joined a robotics team!</li>
    <li><span class="rainbow">I bought my <a href="https://frame.work/" target="_blank">Framework</a> <a
          href="https://nanobot567.github.io/blog/9-21-23.html">Laptop</a> 13!</span></li>
    <li>I somehow got a 4.0 GPA???</li>
    <li>I traveled to Canada!</li>
  </ol>

  <p />
  <b>I think overall it was pretty successful. There were definitely a lot of dips in the road, though.</b>

  <p>Oh, and by the way...</p>
  <h2 class="fastblink" style="color:green">HAPPY NEW YEAR!</h2>
  <p>Here's to the future! Let's hope that we as a human race get our act together..</p>

        <h3><u>2/14/24</u></h3>

        <p>In my spare time, I have slowly been piecing together a new language (written and spoken!) called <span class="rainbow">XYTHESE</span>. I plan to use it in Segfault (formerly known as Overflow) and perhaps in real life, if I get the hang of it.</p>
        <p>The grammar is pretty similar to English, except adjectives are after nouns and negativity is implied through the "noi" prefix (basically, I fixed all of the stuff that I think is stupid in English)</p>
        <p>Here's a simple sentence: "sniyo koda o'utan." It means "your code is stupid".</p>
        <p>You also do not conjugate verbs! Instead, there are tense specification words. For example, the word "kasta" indicates past tense. More complex verb forms can be achieved with word suffixes such as "-don", which is the "-ing" suffix. I've tried to account for word suffixes as well, such as "-er" and "-est". So to say "beautiful", you would first get the word for "beauty" (betsuru), then add the proper suffix, which in this case is "-fulu" for "-ful", resulting in "betsuru-fulu". Pretty easy, I think! :)</p>
        <p>I already have a thousand or so words translated from English, so it's already possible to formulate most simple sentences, and I'll slowly add more as I need them!</p>
        <p>It sounds a lot like Japanese, partially because I'm really trying for that same sort of "feel" of the language. I think I've sort of succeeded, haha. I still need to fine tune a couple of the words since they are a bit hard to pronounce along with, though.</p>

  <h3><u>2/12/23</u></h3>
  <p>Late yesterday night I released a new version of <a href="https://github.com/aos-gui/aos-gui/">AOS-GUI</a>, which I
    really haven't wanted to work on in a long time. I don't really know why I all of the sudden wanted to add a ton of
    new stuff, but hey, progress has been made and I don't regret spending my time on it!</p>
  <p>Another thing that happened, I created a <span class="rainbow"><a
        href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a></span> account, and I like it a lot more than Twitter. It's
    open-source and its API is free! Hopefully a lot of others move over to Mastodon, although a lot of people have
    already migrated over there are still a lot of accounts I followed on Twitter that aren't on Mastodon yet. I also
    hope that more people create bots for it, some of the bots I've already seen are really interesting!</p>

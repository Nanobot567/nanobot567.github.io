        <h4>
            Today was the strangest and most interesting day I've ever had.
        </h4>
        <h4>
	        It started like a normal school day would. Doing work, slacking off because it was nearly the weekend, etc. But during lunchtime someone said over the intercom that there was a tornado watch announced for our location, so everyone was to grab lunch and hurry to 5th period (I still don't know why they said to go to our next class, we could have just, I dunno, gone to the massive non-windowed room 5 steps away from the cafeteria?). So we went to 5th period. It rained hard for about 10 seconds, but after that, the sky was blue and there were no clouds in the sky. An hour later, someone's Honda got crushed by a falling tree, and our local news station came by to cover the story. Not even 30 minutes after this, a <span class="redacted fastblink">TRAIN BLEW UP</span> outside and busted a power line, causing my school to lose power for a solid 15 minutes. THEN we had to leave early at 2:45 because the electrical issues were so bad that it was unsafe to stay in school.

        <h4>
	        At this point you might think that was the end of the story, but no, it keeps going. When I got to the bus station, it was super early so I grabbed a snack and missed the 3:15 bus, which isn't normally a massive deal because I don't usually make it to the station before 3:15. Well, I ended up having to wait <span class="redacted">45 MINUTES</span> for the next next bus to come, because for some reason the bus at 3:35, which I usually depend on, never showed up. So I got on this late bus with my friend lilfigurative and another friend of mine, expecting it to take the usual route. It ended up dropping us off at a random community center. Thankfully I knew where I was and could give my location to my dad.

  <h3><u>10/20/25: Xovanaphobia!</u></h3>

  <p>
    On 10/17/2025, I released my second album, <span class="rainbow">Xovanaphobia</span>!! It's a (much needed)
    departure from the cringe hacker rap whatever I had going on in 2022, and I'm actually pretty proud of it this time!
  </p>

    <i>
      If you're interested in listening to it, it's on most streaming services (I like <a
        href="https://tidal.com/album/466228488" target="_blank">Tidal</a> personally haha), and also on <a
        href="https://nanobot567.bandcamp.com/album/xovanaphobia" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a> for $5
      if you'd rather download the lossless audio :)
    </i>
  </p>

  <p>
    I thought I'd give some background information on all of the songs, just for funsies :P
  </p>

  <h3>On the full album</h3>

  <p>
    The entire album was written over the course of a year or two (off and on), but most of the songs were produced in
    the span of four months! Why did it take so long to write ten songs? I find that forcing creativity only leads to
    mediocre creations (at least for me), so I only wrote a song when an idea came to me naturally.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Xovanaphobia</b> has a meaning, but I'd rather leave it a mystery. I <i>think</i> it's possible to figure it out
    just through song lyrics..?
  </p>

  <p>
    The album cover is a security camera picture, with some non-English text overlaying it! The picture was taken on May
    23rd, 2025. To this day I'm still not entirely sure why the fox stopped by...
  </p>

  <img class="vertblogimage" src="images/10-20-25/cover.png"
    alt="a square image of a security camera picture, featuring a red fox standing on the pavement of a driveway, and facing towards a sliding door. overlaying this picture is some text in a blocky, arcane language, and some company logos in the bottom right corner. These company logos consist of one which looks like a human with their eyes redacted by a rectangle, a flag with three vertical stripes, a bipedal organism with antlers running through a door (similar to the exit sign person), and a glyph which looks like a lambda." />

  <h3>Intro</h3>

  <p>
    This is the first song I wrote for the album! I believe I wrote it in 2023 or 2024.
  </p>

  <p>
    I used <a href="https://tal-software.com/products/tal-vocoder" target="_blank">TAL Vocoder</a> alongside <a
      href="https://vital.audio/" target="_blank">Vital</a> (which provided the vocoder waveform) for the vocals.</p>

  <h3>Ruleset</h3>

  <p>
    Ruleset was written in a <b>single day</b>! I discovered <a href="https://aberrantdsp.com/plugins/digitalis/"
      target="_blank">Digitalis</a>' voice modulation capabilities while making it, leading to the inclusion of the
    female-sounding vocals in this song and pretty much every other one-
  </p>

  <h3>Frills</h3>

  <p>
    I was inspired by some of TOBACCO's work in Sweatbox Dynasty to make Frills. Thank you <a
      href="https://www.excite-audio.com/lifeline/lifeline-console" target="_blank">Lifeline Console Lite</a> :D
  </p>

  <h3>Anthrocon 2634</h3>

  <p>
    The desire to create a drum and bass track overcame me, and this is the result. I envisioned an anthro rave in the
    year 2634 (no way <a href="../archives/worldbuilding/xythia.html">Xythia</a> reference??)!
  </p>

  <p>
    ...the idea sounded cooler in my head, haha.
  </p>

  <h3>H&uacute;xi&amacr;n / Ambrosia</h3>

  <p>The mix on this song is very meh, but I had fun writing it &#175;\_(&#12484;)_/&#175;</p>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huxian" target="_blank">H&uacute;xi&amacr;n</a> is a Chinese fox deity!</p>

  <h3>G.P.B.I.</h3>

  <p>Definitely a filler track. I don't feel very attached to it xD</p>

  <h3>Sol</h3>

  <p>Sol is (I think?) the oldest song I began working on for Xovanaphobia. About a month after <u
      title="DO NOT LISTEN TO IT PLEASE I BEG OF YOU">REDACTED</u>'s release I had the idea for it, put together a messy
    four-bar loop, and promptly let it gather dust in the corner of my Logic Pro projects folder... until I rediscovered
    it!</p>

  <h3>Vulpine Visions</h3>

  <p>
    Probably around half a year ago, I had a dream about an anthropomorphic red fox named <b>Tess</b>. Vulpine Visions
    is kind of based on that, but the dream itself definitely wasn't as interesting as I made it out to be. We quite
    literally interacted once.
  </p>

  <h3>Lodestone</h3>

  <p>Named mostly in reference to the <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Lodestone" target="_blank">Minecraft block</a>,
    but also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lodestone" target="_blank">real-life mineral</a> :)</p>

  <p>
    Lodestone replaced a song called <b>Social Cues</b> which had a similar vibe. The only reason why Social Cues didn't
    make it was because the mix was atrocious, and I could not fix it for the life of me.
  </p>

  <h3>(Just For You) Clinging to Firsts</h3>

  <p>
    This song is actually a segment of some of my improvised piano playing, on my grandparents' piano! You could
    probably tell it was written on the fly, based on how off-beat everything is xP
  </p>

  <p>
    Most of the lyrics are not English! They're purely nonsense, I pulled a Ryan Lindsey and just threw in whatever
    mouth sounds sounded best in the moment.
  </p>

    <p>no iu&#648;o&#651;&#592;n'&alpha;</p>

    <p>no&#651;'oh</p>
  </div>

  <hr />

  <p>
    ...aaaaand that's it!
  </p>

  <p>
    For the record, I probably won't be releasing new music more often... but I am feeling kind of motivated now that I
    have something new out!
  </p>

  <p>
    We shall see.

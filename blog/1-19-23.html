  <h3><u>1/19/23</u></h3>
  <p>Today I started working a custom Launcher.pdx for the <a href="play.date" target="_blank">Playdate</a> console, which I named <span
      class="rainbow">SLINGSHOT!</span> I'm adding all of the features that people really want right now, including app
    searching, sorting, and editing. <i> I do feel kind of bad though, there was another person working on a launcher
      but I just kind of ruined that by making my own...</i></p>
  <p>Creating slingshot was a good idea, not only because having a custom launcher is awesome, but also because it gave
    me an excuse to jailbreak my playdate so I could test it on-device! I did this using Crank2Unlock, an app that shows
    your playdate unlock code. Apparently, through the serial interface, you can access a million commands hidden from
    the user until you use that code to reveal them, such as <code>sysdisk</code> (share the system partition of your
    playdate's disk) and <code>lcdtest</code> (shows a cool stripes pattern on the playdate).</p>
  <p>HACKING STUFF IS SO FUNNNNNNNNNN!!!</p>

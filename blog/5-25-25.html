  <h3><u>5/25/25: Replacing a Ford Taurus X radio</u></h3>
  <p>
    Today I successfully replaced the radio of my <span class="rainbow">2008 Ford Taurus X</span>! The CD drive had
    gotten jammed at some point and hadnâ€™t
    ever recovered, so we thought it might be a good idea to replace it so we have a (practically) fresh unit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Maybe Iâ€™m just used to things being incredibly hard to repair nowadays, but honestly it was easier than I expected!
  </p>

  <p>
    Taking off the control panelâ€™s front was literally as simple as using your fingers to pry it off, and the radio was
    only held in with a bolt in each corner. Actually unbolting it was a bit of a pain though, since the front panel
    was wired to the car and in the way, and it would be more trouble than it was worth to unplug everything then plug
    it back in once the repair was done.

  </p>

  <p>
    I will admit I lost a screw or two in the abyss below the control panel. Thankfully extendable magnets exist and I
    was able to get them out of there X3
  </p>
  <p>
    The radio we bought to replace it didnâ€™t look the best, it had a huge scuff on the display, and the paint on both
    of the seek buttons was completely worn down. BUT it had a working CD drive, and that was really all that mattered.
  </p>
  <p>
    Oh yeah, strangely when installing the new radio, there were only two connectors on the back instead of three like
    on the old
    one..? Iâ€™m 99% sure the leftover connector was for Sirius XM, since everything else seemed to work okay when I gave
    it a
    test run (including the CD drive! was a bit skeptical since it was bought off of ebay haha).
  </p>
  <p>
    I feel like I've always seen Sirius XM advertised on cars, but personally I've never seen anyone use it (<s>does
      anyone use it at all??</s> [<a

      target="_blank">yes</a>, apparently]).
  </p>
  <p>
    Since our old radio had some relatively cool CDs stuck in it (Foo Fighters was a big one) I thought Iâ€™d try taking
    it apart to recover them! The front display came off pretty easy, but after pulling it away from the mainboard I saw
    that it was connected through ribbon cables, which made me think that it would be possible to just swap out the
    entire display since it looked much better than the display on the new one.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately this meant taking apart the Taurusâ€™ control panel again, but I was willing to do that just to make
    everything look a little bit nicer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thankfully the display swap worked perfectly!! Now you canâ€™t even tell that a new radio was put in.

    tadaaaa!
  </p>

  <p>
    Once everything was done and dusted with that, I went back to trying to recover the CDs in the old radio. I ended up
    having to basically destroy the top metal cover just to get inside, and tear apart each lock tab keeping the CDs in
    place. Iâ€™m not too disappointed though, itâ€™s not like I was gonna use a broken radio anyway :3
  </p>

  <p>
    Anyways, I guess Iâ€™m proud I managed to pull that off today! Never really had to work on a car before so this was a
    cool experience.

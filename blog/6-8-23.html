            I have finished working on my Playdate synthesizer!! I decided on a pretty neat name which is VERY <a href=https://teenage.engineering/>teenage engineering</a> inspired. Honestly with enough time you could probably guess the name simply based on their naming scheme, but I don't really care because it's cool :D (I take back what I said about posting the name I decide on here. I kind of want it to be surprise, especially since I now realize people actually read this thing XD* [hi scratchminer if you still read this!])
        </p>
            I'm super ahead of schedule though, I planned to have it done by July 6th, when the Playdate Direct is. I suppose now I have a ton of time to beta test it and get everything ready for release!
        </p>
            In other news, I got my replacement Playdate in from Panic a couple weeks ago! I've been checking my old one's "last sync" status to see if they've been able to bring it back from the dead, but it's been 3 weeks and I don't think it's coming back :(. Shame.
        </p>
            In other OTHER news, I plan to finish AOS-GUI v0.9 by the end of the summer. If everything goes to plan, AOS will have its first (non-beta) release by the end of this year! Super pumped to make it even better. I figure I'll have AOS script (working on the name), the programming language for doing all sorts of operations in AOS, done by that time as well. It'll probably have a lua/python like syntax, but we'll see :)

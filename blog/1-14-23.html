        <p>
            Tonight was the first homecoming dance I've ever been to. It was really fun! I didn't dance or anything, but it was still a good time because I got to hang out with <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span>, and a bunch of other people in my friend group.
          <p>
            Observations:
            <ul>
              <li>- It was really, <i>really</i> loud.</li>
              <li>- It was pretty awkward being with <span class="redacted">[REDACTED]</span> when a million other people were around, especially when we <span class="redacted">[NULL]</span>. (That doesn't mean it wasn't amazing, however.)</li>
              <li>- People were going absolutely INSANE. When a top 40 song came on, everybody lost their minds.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>
            ...and that's about it. I wish I had more to say, but I don't.

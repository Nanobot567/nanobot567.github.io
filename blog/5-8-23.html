I want it to be kind of like a souped-up <a href="https://teenage.engineering/products/po">Pocket Operator</a> with extra features.
I plan to bump the step count up to 64 and implement the FX and LFO modules soon, but unfortunately I can't test on hardware right now since my Playdate's kind of dead. I tried updating from recovery OS 1.11.1 to 1.13.7 (for reasons I don't want to say here) and it started bootlooping as soon as the update began applying. I sent an email to Playdate support but honestly I'm skeptical that they'll be able to fix it, from what I can tell the serial interface doesn't work and the System partition is corrupted. The good thing is, I was able to access the Data partition through spamming the reset button in the crank dock so all of my save data and games are backed up on my computer.
ANYWAYS, as of now my synthesizer is unnamed. Name contenders include <span class="redacted">Kronos</span>, <span class="rainbow">WaveDate</span>, and Mono(chrome). I'm kind of leaning towards Kronos, it definitely sounds the coolest. I'll post an update later once I decide on a name.

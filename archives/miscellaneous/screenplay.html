  <h3><u>Screenplay formatting</u></h3>

  <p>Screenplays are traditionally written on 8.5 inch (21.5 cm) by 11 inch (27.9 cm) paper, with a monospace font
    (Courier mainly).</p>

  <p>Screenplays can be broken down into seven core elements:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Scene</li>
    <li>Description</li>
    <li>Character</li>
    <li>Parenthetical</li>
    <li>Dialogue</li>
    <li>Action</li>
    <li>Transition</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>General Abbreviations</h3>

  <p>These abbreviations can be used throughout the script when necessary, but are mostly used in action and dialogue
    descriptions.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>(p.o.v.): point of view</li>
    <li>(o.s.): off screen</li>
    <li>(m.o.s.): without sound</li>
    <li>(v.o.): voice over</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Scene</h3>

  <p>Scene headings are written in all caps, and are prefixed with either the abbreviation <b>INT.</b> (as in
    <b>INTERIOR.</b>) or <b>EXT.</b> (as in <b>EXTERIOR.</b>). The actual name of the location is placed afterwards.
    If subsequent actions take place in a small part of the main location (ex. kitchen in a house), a slash can be
    used to separate the main title of the location and the section's name. If it is necessary for context, the
    overall location of a scene (ex. city or nation) can be specified in parenthesis. Optionally, the time of day
    (either DAY or NIGHT) can be placed after the location name, separated by a hyphen.
  </p>

  <p>Scene headings should be kept relatively brief, and should be aligned to the left of the page.</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p>
      EXT. MAXETATSA PARK (XYTHIA) - NIGHT
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>Description</h3>

  <p>If needed, a description of the current setting can be provided, but as a general rule of thumb it's preferred to
    keep these short. These should be aligned to the left like regular text.</p>

  <h3>Character</h3>

  <p>Character cues are written in all caps, with 4.2 inch left margin, a 1.0 inch right margin, and a 3.3 inch width.
  </p>

  <div class="block">
    <p>
      RAMONA
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>Parenthetical</h3>

  <p>Parentheticals describe the emotional subtext of a line of dialogue or action. These have 3.6 inch left margins,
    2.9 inch right margins, and a 2.0 inch width, and should also be kept short and used rarely. These can be used in
    the middle of dialogue, but the dialogue must continue afterwards on a new line.</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p>
      (softly)
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>Dialogue</h3>

  <p>Dialogue is what characters say in a scene, and follows traditional grammatical and syntactical rules. Dialogue
    lines should have a 2.9 inch left margin, 2.3 inch right margin, and a 3.3 inch width.</p>

  <p>If a character interrupts another, the dialogue must end with an em-dash, then continue with a new character cue
    and dialogue segment on a new line.</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p>
      Hey... <br />
      (beat) <br />
      ...you know I really care about you, right? <br />
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>Action</h3>

  <p>Actions are performed by characters in a scene, and are written as standard English.</p>

  <div class="block">
    <p>
      Ramona looks at him, a rarely seen seriousness in her gaze.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>Transition</h3>

  <p>Transitions should have a 6.0 inch left margin, a 1.0 inch right margin, and a 1.5 inch width. Transitions can be
    pretty much anything, but some examples include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>DISSOLVE TO:</b></li>

    <li><b>FADE IN/OUT.</b></li>
  </ul>

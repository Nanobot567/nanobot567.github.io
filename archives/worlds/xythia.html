  <h3><u>The Republic of Xythia (Earth, 2634 A.D.)</u></h3>

  <p><b>Xythia is what earthlings of the year 2634 call what was known in 2025 as the United States of America.</b></p>

  <h3>History</h3>

  <p>In the year 2025 A.D., a president was elected into office who destroyed what was then called the United States of America, through numerous financial missteps and general inconsideration for the majority of the country's population. After three years of their presidency, not even their entire term, the United States found itself in such a tremendous amount of debt and citizen dissatisfaction that the country collapsed. America became an unnamed, chaotic mass of land with no leader or law until 2067, when a philanthropist named Oliver Cantrell bought the land for the 2025 equivalent of $137 billion dollars and named himself president "until America was whipped back into shape". After twenty years of his presidency, America recovered somewhat but still wasn't what it used to be, so a group of revolutionaries decided to overthrow president Cantrell and start fresh under a new name: <b>The Republic of Xythia</b>.</p>

  <p>Xythia became one of the most successful countries in history in a very short amount of time, becoming one of the best places to live in the world due to an economic boom and territorial expansion in the early 2100s. However, in 2144, Xythia's first president died off, which gave some less-than-capable people an entrypoint into high government positions. Xythia quickly lost its status as a world power, and from that point onward Xythia has remained a decent place to live, however decisions are frequently made regarding the country which are not the best for its citizens. In 2153, for example, the <b>Terrain Division Act</b> was passed, which split Xythia into five <a href="#geography">sectors</a> and constructed guarded borders between them (thankfully the physical borders were removed in an addendum to the act in 2231).</p>

  <p>In 2600, some human infants in Xythia suddenly began to develop animal-like features, growing tails, snouts, antlers, and everything in between. Various hypotheses were formed trying to explain this phenomenon, but the general consensus was a genetic engineer released several strands of virus into the world, each of which dedicated to turning humans into a specific species of human-animal crossbreed. These mutants, then referred to as <b>anthros</b>, became a heated topic of discussion for many. Some believed they should be treated just the same as anyone else; others thought they belonged in facilities separate from the rest of the world. For years anthros remained in a legal gray area, until 2603 when amendments were added to the Xythian constitution declaring them legal citizens of Xythia. Although they were now rightfully equal to "pure" humans, speciesism still ran rampant in all sectors, causing some groups such as the <b>Anthro Advocation Association</b> and the <b>Species Equalists</b> to form and host protests vouching for equal treatment laws.</p>

  <p>Even in 2634 these issues are still present, and anthros continue to fight for equality on all fronts.</p>

  <h3 id="geography">Geography</h3>

  <p>Xythia consists of a large portion of the Earth's territory, including the following areas (named as they would have in 2025):</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The United States of America</li>
    <li>Eastern China</li>
    <li>Most of Russia (some territories requested separation from Xythia, notably the city of Moscow)</li>
    <li>Parts of South America</li>
    <li>Small portions of northern Africa</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Xythia is divided into five sectors: </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Voren</b>: the central and most healthily populated sector, containing most of Xythia's largest cities.</li>
    <li><b>Nesaita</b>: the western sector, mostly a lush, waterlogged swamp and forest.
    <li><b>Kiotse</b>: the northern sector, a cold but bustling area full of Canadian immigrants.
    <li><b>Arena</b>: the southern sector, a vast and mostly uninhabitable desert, although some have decided to live there in order to "live life on hard mode".
    <li><b>Eroth</b>: the eastern sector, riddled with the remains of ancient cities. mostly inaccessible to the general public for historical purposes.
  </ul>

  <h3>Languages</h3>

  <p>Due to past strictly enforced borders, Xythians in each sector speak their own dialect of Xythese, a derivative of English. In an attempt to simplify communication for citizens, the Xythian government created <a href="../languages/xythese.html">Unified Xythese</a>, which has been adopted by most and is the Republic's official language.</p>

  <p>Although Xythese is prevalent across all of Xythia, Xythians in more rural areas typically stick to speaking Urkava.</p>

  <p><b>R Limited</b> is a company devoted to giving the population technology they didn't know they needed, and at prices anyone can afford. Their currency, [non-unicode character], is not a physical thing. It is, as R says, 'simply the amount of human you have left in you'.</p>

  <p>R has historically been very controversial due to their usage of incredibly powerful and revolutionary components in their products. These components allow for the previously impossible to become possible, such as time travel, direct brain interfaces, and more.</p>

  <p>To this day, R has (somehow) managed to avoid legal troubles...</p>
